        <Sent id="1.1">The IETF meetings tend to become too large, creating logistics and planning problems. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.2">I suggest that future meetings are held for two weeks, with applications and user services issues the first week, and all other issues the second week. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">Those who so wish could attend both weeks, and other people could attend only one week. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.4">Those who choose to attend both weeks would be able to cover more groups and do better liaisons between the different areas. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.5">The Friday of the first week could discuss applications issues which might be of special interest to the other areas, and the Monday of the second week would schedule other groups which might be of special interest to applications people, so some people could attend Monday-Monday or Friday-Friday.

</Sent>
        <Sent id="2.2">My problem over the past year or so is that there are only a few session I wish to attend, but I cannot know for sure when they will be scheduled, so I cannot make reasonable travel arrangements (a week in Orlando for 6 hours of meetings is hard to sell to management). </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.3">Now I know there is a rationale here, and that one is encouraged to participate broadly. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.4">And I am hopeful that new activities (my own and in the IETF) will give me many more reasons to attend. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="2.5">But firmer scheduling would be a big win.

        <Sent id="3.2">WG Chairs already are asked to specify which clashes they want to avoid, but clash avoidance is an iterative problem. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.3">I just don't see how late changes can be completely avoided. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.4">Obviously, everybody knows they need to be minimised. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="3.5">Jacob, 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="3.6">No way. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.7">Taking one week out of our calendars 3 times a year is already very painful, and a lot of people really do need and want to track multiple areas of the IETF. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.8">Spreading it thinner would be awful.

      <Text>
        <Sent id="4.1">Working groups don't seem to decide at the last minute whether or not they need a meeting, or what their conflict avoidance criteria needs to be. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.2">This leads me to believe that we could create the IETF schedule earlier without causing significant pain. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.3">For example, it would be very useful so that the final WG schedule was available more than 21 days in advance, in order to get advanced purchase tickets. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.4">This would mean that the apps area schedule should be set tentatively 30-35 days in advance, so that the draft IETF schedule could be published and conflicts reviewed.

        <Sent id="1.1">hi all, 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.2">As outlined at the face to face meet, I've been working on methods of getting coordinate information about the locations of Semantic web researchers and groups. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">I wrote to the www-rdf-interest list asking for data: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.4">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003Apr/0252.html 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.5">so we'll have to see how that pans out. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.6">Please do add yourselves if you've not already there (I just did a few as examples). 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.7">There are some SVG demos, developed from ones by Jim Ley, displaying the information we have already, which I constructed as examples: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.8">http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200303/geo/intro.html#demos 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.9">So, now we have to decide on the map which we will use to overlay the dots on. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.10">We want something that will highlight Europe, especially since on a world map, Europe is too small to really show up on provide the level of detail we require. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.11">At ILRT, Caroline Meek, Dan and I have had discussions with a designer, and he has pointed us at some examples, and we've narrowed it down to two that we rather like:

        <Sent id="1.12">http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/brand%20x/maps%20and%20globes/t_bxp_c31027.jpg.jpg 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.13">which has the advantage of showing Europe as part of the world (we could get rid of the arm of the globe that is showing, and alter the colours); 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.14">and http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/ds/maps%20and%20globes/t_11407324.jpg.jpg 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.15">which would be technically simpler to do, but shows Europe in isolation (I do like the colour scheme though). 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.16">Do people have a preference for one style over the other? 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.17">Could you let us know today if possible? </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.18">We need to specify the map as soon as possible in order to get postcards printed for www2003. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.19">thanks,
